## Hi there 👋

Hello everybody,

I am a computer scientist 
with experience in the field of a fullstack developer.

I collected my experience while developing various apps and websites
for big companies, private clients, events and friends
using up-to-date web technologies and frameworks.

I created websites and desktop apps using
- pure `HTML`, `JS`, `CSS`
- `Angular` and corresponding component libraries
- `Angular` together with `electron.js`
- integrating `Angular`- and pure `HTML`/`JS`/`CSS`-websites into `WordPress`

Of course, every frontend has a backend.
Backend technologies I work with include
- `Java` with `Spring` or `Spring Boot`
- `Node.js`
- `C#` with `ASP.NET Core`

In developing software there are two essential building blocks: user experience and developer experience.
Clean coding and documenting provides good developer experience and is necessary for developing functioning, performant and effective software together.
Using design principles for UI and UX and utilitzing fields as interaction and information design is necessary to provide a great user experience.

I complement this approach of design thinking with system thinking - 
having the big picture in mind when working on the small ones.
This makes my work very holistic.
